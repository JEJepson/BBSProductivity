# a displaying bird, a single bird, a nest, a brood, and of course, a pair!
# e.g. 8 birds were seen, 3 were in pairs, 2 were singles = 5 pairs.

# Dabbling Ducks

# Mallard, Gadwall, Pintail, Shoveler, Teal, Wigeon

# Pairs, single males, males in groups of 2-4 are all counted as pairs.
# e.g. flock of 3 males, 2 pairs, single male, single male = 7 pairs
# Exclude groups of five or more males in the estimates of breeding pairs.
# Larger groups and flocks are probably non-breeding or wintering flocks. 
# NB. DO NOT USE THE FIRST VISIT FIGURES.  
# Report the highest no. of pairs seen on the 2nd and 3rd visit.
